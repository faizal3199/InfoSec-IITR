### Who We Are?

InfoSecIITR is a group of information security enthusiasts from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IITR). It is an open group that is run entirely by students, and consists only of IITR students and alumni. We are a bunch of self motivated security entusiasts who love learning and sharing their knowledge with everyone genuinely interested in information security.

### What We Do?

* Meetings: We have weekly meetups where we have information security related discussions and participate in CTFs. Everyone is invited to our meetings. The schedule can be found here. 

* Capture The Flag: We actively participate in CTFs. These are security competitions which require practical knowledge of topics like binary exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography, web security, forensics, steganography etc. We also organize our own Capture The Flag competitions on Backdoor in collaboration with SDSLabs. The notable ones being: BackdoorCTF (our annual flagship CTF), ScytheCTF, n00bCTF (a high-school level CTF for getting started).

### How to Join?
InfoSecIITR is an open group. Everyone (from IITR) can join in our meetings and participate with us in CTFs (subject to rules on team size in CTFs, of course). If you come regularly to the meetings, you get added to the internal Slack team.
